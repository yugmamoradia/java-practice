/**
 * Exercise 3:
 Us government ask our team to develop an application for traditional weighing machine. can you please develop an application.
 Hint : create a loop statement in which it should ask left side and right side weights, whenever both sides are equal then it should come out of loop.

 Output e.g 1:
 Enter left side weight
 20
 Enter right side weight
 20
 both are same weights

 Output e.g 2:
 Enter left side weight
 32
 Enter right side weight
 20
 both are not same weights

 Enter left side weight
 16
 Enter right side weight
 32
 both are not same weights

 Enter left side weight
 36
 Enter right side weight
 32
 both are same weights//because 32+16+36 == 20+32+32
